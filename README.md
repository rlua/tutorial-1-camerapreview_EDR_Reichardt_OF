This is an Android Studio project for an app to demonstrate in real time the Event Driven Representation (EDR) (Chen, Liu et al), Reichardt detector and Optical Flow (Farneback).
The app was based on an OpenCV camera application.

Once the apk is installed on an Android smart phone, tap on the app icon to run. Tap the screen to switch between EDR, Reichardt and OF.
